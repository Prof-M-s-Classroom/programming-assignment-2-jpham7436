1|You wake up in a tent. There is a table with some objects to your left. Investigate the table (1) or exit the tent (2)?|2|3|
2|You approach the table. There is a set of keys, a backpack, and a weird trapdoor on the side. Go through the backpack (1) or go through the trapdoor (2)?|4|5|
3|You find the tent in the middle of a park. There are castle walls around you. Explore the park (1) or explore the castle (2)?|6|7|
4|You find a laptop and a flute in the backpack. They seem important. Start up the laptop (1) or play the flute (2)?|8|9|
5|You open the trapdoor and find a dark cave with a ladder. You go down the ladder as the stench of rotting bodies fill your nose. Your eyes start to tear up, and in your temporary blindness, your hands miss a rung and you fall to the bottom. You understand where the smell is coming from as you jump up from a pile of rotting bodies. Do you try to find a way up (1) or scream for help (2)?|10|11|
6|The park is larger than you thought. There is a small river flowing through it and a path that goes in front of you and behind you. Do you follow the path in front (1) or behind you (2)?|12|13|
7|You make your way towards a large hall. There is a huge table with wooden bowls and silverware everywhere. However, there is nobody there - it seems like it was recently abandoned. Do you try to find some food to eat (1) or keep exploring (2)?|14|15|
8|You boot up the laptop and there is a password. You do not know what the password is. Try random combinations until you get it right (1) or try to figure something else out (2)?|16|17|
9|You start playing the flute, and almost like magic, your fingers remember an ancient, earthly song. The noise fills your brain, reigniting your memory. You are a sort of bard for the royal court. There was an attack on the castle, and you fell and hit your head. After remembering your identity, do you go outside to find your doctor (1) or lay down and rest (2)?|18|19|
10|The last rung is a few feet above your head. You try your best to jump, but your fingers can't get enough grip to support your body. Do you try pushing the bodies together to make the pile higher (1) or try to find another way out (2)?|20|21|
11|You scream "HELPPPP" for hours until your mouth can barely croak. You think there's no hope left, until somebody drop a rope. They yell at you to climb up, but they don't sound friendly. Do you climb the rope (1) or try to find another way out (2)?|22|21|
12|You follow the path in front of you and get to the edge of the park. The castle walls loom around you and a large wooden gate blocks your path. In the distance, you can see a large cloud of dust getting closer as the ground starts to rumble. Do you try to find a way to get to the other side (1) or climb the castle walls (2)?|24|25|
13|You follow the path behind you and eventually reach a gate. Behind it, you can only see a thick forest. All you can do is enter the forest (1).|26|-1|
14|You ravage towards the tables as your stomach growls. While they may be leftovers, food is still food. You find a warm bowl of soup, but just as you are about to take a bite, somebody screams "FIRE!!!". Do you go investigate the noise (1) or continue eating (2)?|28|29|
15|You keep exploring and find a room filled with gold and a massive throne. "Why would someone leave this here?" you think as you enter the room. You hear a faint click and instinctively step back as an arrow whooshes by your face. Do you keep going deeper into the room (1) or leave (2)?|30|30|
16|You start with 0000. Once you've tried 0009, the computer explodes and you die LOL.|-1|-1|
17|You set the laptop down and continue to explore inside the tent, but you can't find any clues. It's been weeks since you first woke up. You don't remember anything about your whereabouts. Hours blend together as you walk around inside the tent until you eventually die from dehydration. Should have chose better I guess.|-1|-1|
18|You try to look for a doctor. As you walk outside the tent, you trip, hit your head again, and pass out. Damn you suck.|-1|-1|
19|You lay back down and go through your memories. As you fall back asleep, the sound of an elegant flute fill your ears and lull you to bed. Nice, good ending <3|-1|-1|
20|As you push the pile dead bodies tighter and higher, the stench makes your nose flare and your eyes tear up. You finally succeed, and after a few rounds of throwing up, you are prepared to climb up the ladder. You think to yourself "What happened?" before you make it to the top and pass out. You are weak, but alive."|-1|-1|
21|You walk past the pile of bodies and venture deeper into the tunnel. Inside, you find a few more rooms. Some have beds, some have tables, there is even a fridge and a stovetop in one of the rooms. As you keep walking, the tunnels become less and less refined. YOu can't find anymore more rooms and it looks like nobody has been this far. You keep walking, getting lost and finally lay down from exhaustion. Will you find your way out, or die down there by yourself? Who knows (cavedivers am I right).|-1|-1|
22|Slowly, but surely, you climb the rope and make your way out of the tunnel. At the top, you find a soldier. Your eyes lock for a brief second before he recognizes that you are not his ally. Before you can make a noise, he shoots you and your body falls down the cave to join the other rotting corpses. Sucks to suck.|-1|-1|
23|PLACEHOLDER NODE. Nothing points to this node, but it exists to keep the order of nodes correct. Sorry for the waste of memory. |-1|-1|
24|You were able to break down a weak part of the gate and get through. The noises get louder as the dust cloud gets closer. You realize that huge army tanks are causing the dust clouds, and as they approach, they attack you and the castle. Your flimsy body explodes in spectacular fashion. Take the L.|-1|-1|
25|You find a ladder leading to the top of the castle gates. There, other people look at you incredulously. "You aren't supposed to be awake yet," one of them says. You have no idea who they are, but they hand you a rifle and instruct you to help them. The approaching dust cloud gets closer and you realize that a line of army tanks is causing the ruckus. You start firing, adrenaline pumping as you wildly shoot at the tanks to no avail. They shoot down the walls of the castle, and you close your eyes as you fall. You die a glorious death.|-1|-1|
26|You enter the forest, and very quickly, you get lost. The castle walls are nowhere in sight, and you fear that you are only getting more and more lost. As night falls, you find a small stream for water and continue to walk. You come across a small cave and choose to rest there for the night. Your new life begins in the wilderness.|-1|-1|
27|PLACEHOLDER NODE. Nothing points to this node, but it exists to keep the order of nodes correct. Sorry for the waste of memory. |-1|-1|
28|You walk towards where the noise came from when suddenly, the wall next to you explodes. For a brief second, you see an explosion as your body is ripped apart.|-1|-1|
29|You dive into the bowl, not caring about the cause of the shout. The hearty soup fills your stomach as you instinctively smile, soup falling from your lips. You close your eyes, and before you can feel anything, a shot rings out as a bullet tears through your skull. You instantly die, but at least your attacker was merciful. You died happy.|-1|-1|
30|As you take another step, you hear another click and the wall closes behind you. You are now trapped in the room, and unfortunately, you can't find a way out. You sit there and wait, and after another 2 hours, you start falling asleep. Out of nowhere, the surrounding walls explode. You are terrified as you back away from the crumbling walls. For a brief second, you see a flash of red and orange before you die. An explosion rips apart your body before you could realize what happened.|-1|-1|
